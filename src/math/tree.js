/**
 * Tiny extension of jQuery adding directionalized DOM manipulation methods.
 *
 * Funny how Pjs v3 almost just works with `jQuery.fn.init`.
 *
 * jQuery features that don't work on $:
 *   - jQuery.*, like jQuery.ajax, obviously (Pjs doesn't and shouldn't
 *                                            copy constructor properties)
 *
 *   - jQuery(function), the shortcut for `jQuery(document).ready(function)`,
 *     because `jQuery.fn.init` is idiosyncratic and Pjs doing, essentially,
 *     `jQuery.fn.init.apply(this, arguments)` isn't quite right, you need:
 *
 *       _.init = function(s, c) { jQuery.fn.init.call(this, s, c, $(document)); };
 *
 *     if you actually give a shit (really, don't bother),
 *     see https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.7.2/src/core.js#L889
 *
 *   - jQuery(selector), because jQuery translates that to
 *     `jQuery(document).find(selector)`, but Pjs doesn't (should it?) let
 *     you override the result of a constructor call
 *       + note that because of the jQuery(document) shortcut-ness, there's also
 *         the 3rd-argument-needs-to-be-`$(document)` thing above, but the fix
 *         for that (as can be seen above) is really easy. This problem requires
 *         a way more intrusive fix
 *
 * And that's it! Everything else just magically works because jQuery internally
 * uses `this.constructor()` everywhere (hence calling `$`), but never ever does
 * `this.constructor.find` or anything like that, always doing `jQuery.find`.
